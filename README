Sloop is an Android application for browsing open data in CSV format.
You can point sloop to any URL containing a CSV file, and it will
attempt to render that data in a browseable form, allowing you to
swipe your way through records.

Sloop is currently in early prototype.  This is not (yet) a complete
application for end users, but is developing rapidly.  The source code
for the browser itself is available separately:

Sloop is in the Public Domain.  See the LICENSE file for details.
